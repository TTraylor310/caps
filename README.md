## Project: Code Academy Parcel Service (CAPS)

### Author: Tim Traylor

### Problem Domain

A real-time service that allows for vendors, such as flower shops or restaurants, to alert a system of a package needing to be delivered, for drivers to instantly see whatâ€™s in their pickup queue, and then to alert the vendors as to the state of the deliveries (in transit, and then delivered).

- [CI/CD GitHub Actions](https://github.com/TTraylor310/caps/actions)

#### Running the app

`node server.js` will start the server to listen
`node driverHub/driverHub.js` will start the driver module to listen
`node vendor/vendorHub.js` will start the orders and the flow of information
